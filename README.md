# Advanced Web Programming Projects

This repository includes some of my main projects from "Advanced Web Programming" -- a course I completed in 9th grade of high school.

### Advanced Web Programming
The course involved using PHP (a server-side object-oriented language designed to construct dynamic webpages) to design, build, and test increasingly complex programs. Software development focused on server-side web processing, creation of a function library to maintain structured and useable code, and the use of server-side databases for content management. Topics include the software design process, algorithms, control structures, data structures, user interface design, debugging techniques, security, database use, and software testing. More specifically, the covered topics were functions, strings, arrays, HTML forms processing (GET and POST), cookies, sessions, security, MySQL, and AJAX.
